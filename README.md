# neural-network-citynames
Basic neural network to generate new city names

Only necessary file is app.py

## Setup Tutorial
For this tutorial, you will need pip, which is a package manager for Python, and TensorFlow, as well as TFLearn. 

You might get errors that weren't explained in the video. I suggest you use VirtualEnv so that you can proceed without worrying about existing installations etc...

https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#virtualenv-installation

1. so first, make a new directory somewhere and enter it. 
2. inside, make a new python file and write the code Siraj tells you to write
3. in the same directory, perform all the necessary commands in the link above.
4. first, install pip. If you are using Mac OSX, this will be 'sudo easy_install pip'
5. then, install the upgraded version of virtual env. this will be 'sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv'
6. then, run virtualenv in your current directory. this will be 'virtualenv --system-site-packages ./'
7. Then activate the environment by doing 'source ./bin/activate' or the other, if you are not using bash
8. Then just continue from there since the commands listed should work by default. 
9. don't forget to install tflearn by doing this: `pip install tflearn` after you activate and install tensorflow
10. Hope this helps.ï»¿
